# Spatiotemporal Overlap Positioner

This is the unfinished skeleton of a program meant to interface a Dataray CMOS camera with both a micrometer stange and piezo-electric mirror stage. I chose to do this as a quality-of-life improvement in the lab, as well as to help improve my understanding of object-oriented programming. This is on hold for now, but I intend on putting more time into finishing it in the future.
